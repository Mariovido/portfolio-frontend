# 3443. Maximum Manhattan Distance After K Changes

## Intuition

The problem aims to find the maximum possible Manhattan distance after processing a sequence of directional moves `(N, S, E, W)`, with the allowance to modify up to `k` moves. The core idea is to track net displacement and adjust it optimally using the allowed changes.

## Approach

1. Initialize counters for the four directions (`north`, `south`, `east`, `west`).
2. Iterate through each character in the input string `s`:
   1. Update the respective direction counter based on the move.
3. For each step:
   1. Compute the current horizontal (`x = |east - west|`) and vertical (`y = |north - south|`) displacements.
   2. The Manhattan distance is `x + y`.
   3. Calculate how many steps can be used to increase the distance, up to `2 * k` (since one move can increase by `2` at most).
   4. Ensure the increase doesnâ€™t exceed the remaining "slack" in the current step count.
4. Keep track of the maximum possible Manhattan distance after each iteration and adjustment.
5. Return the maximum value computed.

## Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`, since we process each move once.

- Space complexity: `O(1)`, using a fixed number of variables regardless of input size.

## Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDistance(String s, int k) {
        int result = 0;

        int north = 0;
        int south = 0;
        int east = 0;
        int west = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);

            if (c == 'N') north++;
            else if (c == 'S') south++;
            else if (c == 'E') east++;
            else if (c == 'W') west++;

            int x = Math.abs(east - west);
            int y = Math.abs(north - south);
            int manhattanDistance = x + y;
            int maxIncrease = Math.min(2 * k, (i + 1) - manhattanDistance);

            result = Math.max(result, manhattanDistance + maxIncrease);
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
