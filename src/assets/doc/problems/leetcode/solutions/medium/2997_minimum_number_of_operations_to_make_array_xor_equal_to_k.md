# 2997. Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array XOR Equal to K

## Intuition

The given problem seems to be about finding the minimum number of operations to modify the `XOR` of an array such that it matches a given target `k`. An operation is defined as toggling a single bit in the `XOR` result of the array elements. Initial thought is that this could be efficiently done using bitwise operations, considering the binary representations of the `XOR` result and the target number `k`.

## Approach

1. Calculate the `XOR` of all numbers in the array `nums`. This will give us the current `XOR` of all elements combined.
2. Initialize a counter `count` to track the number of bit changes needed.
3. Compare the least significant bit (LSB) of the current `XOR` (`finalXor`) with the LSB of `k`. If they are different, increment the `count` by `1`.
4. Right-shift both `finalXor` and `k` by `1` bit to check the next bit in subsequent iterations.
5. Repeat steps `3`-`4` until both `finalXor` and `k` become `0`.
6. Return the `count` as the result, which represents the minimum number of operations needed.

## Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(log(max(finalXor, k)))`

  - This complexity comes from the fact that the while loop iterates over the number of bits in the larger of `finalXor` or `k`. The number of iterations is bounded by the number of bits needed to represent the maximum of these two numbers.

- Space complexity: `O(1)`
  - No additional space is needed beyond the input and a few variables for computation.

## Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums, int k) {
        int finalXor = 0;
        for (int n : nums) {
            finalXor = finalXor ^ n;
        }

        int count = 0;
        while (k > 0 || finalXor > 0) {
            if ((k % 2) != (finalXor % 2)) count++;

            k /= 2;
            finalXor /= 2;
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```
