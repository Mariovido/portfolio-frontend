# 1639. Number of Ways to Form a Target String Given a Dictionary

## Intuition

The problem seems to involve counting the number of ways to form a target string from a given array of words. We can utilize dynamic programming to efficiently compute the number of ways.

## Approach

1. Initialize variables for modulo, target length (`len`), and maximum length of words in the array (`max`).
2. Create a `2D` array `charFrequency` to store the frequency of characters at each position in the words.
3. Populate `charFrequency` by iterating through each `word` in the array and updating the character frequencies.
4. Initialize a `2D` array `dp` to store the number of ways to form the `target` string.
5. Set the base case: `dp[0]` represents the number of ways to form an empty string, which is `1` for any valid length of the word.
6. Iterate over the `target` string characters.
   - For each character, iterate over possible positions to place that character in the `word` array.
   - Update `dp[i][ch]` using the recurrence relation:` dp[i][ch] = (dp[i - 1][ch - 1] * charFrequency[ch - 1][target.charAt(i - 1) - 'a'] % MOD + dp[i][ch - 1]) % MOD`.
7. Return `dp[len][max]`, which represents the number of ways to form the entire `target` string.

## Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n * m * l)`, where `n` is the length of the target string, `m` is the maximum length of words in the array, and `l` is the length of the longest word in the array.

- Space complexity: `O(m * 26 + (n + 1) * (m + 1))`, where `m` is the maximum length of words in the array and `n` is the length of the target string.

## Code

```java
class Solution {
    private int MOD = 1000000007;

    public int numWays(String[] words, String target) {
        int len = target.length();
        int max = words[0].length();

        int[][] charFrequency = new int[max][26];
        for (String word : words) {
            for (int i = 0; i < max; i++) {
                charFrequency[i][word.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
            }
        }

        long[][] dp = new long[len + 1][max + 1];
        dp[0] = LongStream.range(0, max + 1).map(e -> 1).toArray();

        for (int i = 1; i <= len; i++) {
            for (int ch = i; ch <= max + i - len; ch++) {
                dp[i][ch] = (dp[i - 1][ch - 1] *
                    charFrequency[ch - 1][target.charAt(i - 1) - 'a'] % MOD + dp[i][ch - 1]) % MOD;
            }
        }

        return (int) dp[len][max];
    }
}
```
