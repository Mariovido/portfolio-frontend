# 2331. Evaluate Boolean Binary Tree

## Description

This problem involves evaluating a full binary tree where leaf nodes represent boolean values (`True` or `False`), and non-leaf nodes represent boolean operations (`OR` and `AND`). The task is to compute the result of the boolean expression represented by the tree structure and node values.

## Function

```java
public boolean evaluateTree(TreeNode root) {}
```

## Input Format

- A binary tree where leaf nodes have values `0` or `1` (`False` or `True` respectively), and non-leaf nodes have values `2` or `3` (`OR` and `AND` operations respectively).
- The input tree is provided as a node structure `TreeNode`.

## Output Format

- Return a boolean result of evaluating the root based on its child nodes and associated boolean operations.

## Constraints

- The tree contains between `1` and `1000` nodes.
- Node values are either `0`, `1`, `2`, or `3`.
- Each node has either `0` or `2` children.
- Leaf nodes are defined by the values `0` or `1`.
- Non-leaf nodes perform either an `OR` (`2`) or `AND` (`3`) operation.

## Example

```bash
# Sample Input
TreeNode root = new TreeNode(2, new TreeNode(1), new TreeNode(3, new TreeNode(0), new TreeNode(1)));

# Sample Output
true
```
