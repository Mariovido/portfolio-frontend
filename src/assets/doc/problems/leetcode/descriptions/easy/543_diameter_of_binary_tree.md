# 543. Diameter of Binary Tree

## Description

Given the root of a binary tree, this problem involves finding the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in the tree, where the path may or may not pass through the root. The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

## Function

```java
public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {}
```

## Input Format

- The input is the root node of a binary tree.

## Output Format

- An integer representing the length of the diameter of the binary tree.

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
- Node values are in the range `[-100, 100]`.

## Example

```bash
# Sample Input
root = [1,2,3,4,5]

# Sample Output
3
```
