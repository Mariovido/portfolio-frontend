# 206. Reverse Linked List

## Description

Given the head of a singly linked list, this problem involves reversing the list and returning the reversed list. Both iterative and recursive solutions are explored.

## Function

```java
public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {}
```

## Input Format

- The head of a singly linked list.

## Output Format

- The head of the reversed singly linked list.

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 5000]`.
- Node values are in the range `[-5000, 5000]`.

## Follow-up:

- Implement both iterative and recursive solutions.

## Example

```bash
# Sample Input
head = [1,2,3,4,5]

# Sample Output
[5,4,3,2,1]
```
