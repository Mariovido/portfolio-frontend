# 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

## Description

Given the root of a binary tree, this problem involves finding and returning its maximum depth. The maximum depth of a binary tree is defined as the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

## Function

```java
public int maxDepth(TreeNode root) {}
```

## Input Format

- The root node of the binary tree.

## Output Format

- An integer representing the maximum depth of the binary tree.

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- Node values are in the range `[-100, 100]`.

## Example

```bash
# Sample Input
root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]

# Sample Output
3
```
