# 268. Missing Number

## Description

Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, this problem involves finding the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

## Function

```java
public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {}
```

## Input Format

- An array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers.

## Output Format

- An integer representing the missing number in the range.

## Constraints

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^4`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= n`
- All numbers in `nums` are unique.

## Follow-up

- Could you implement a solution using only `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` runtime complexity?

## Example

```bash
# Sample Input
nums = [3,0,1]

# Sample Output
2
```
