# 169. Majority Element

## Description

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, this problem involves finding and returning the majority element, which is the element that appears more than `n/2` times.

## Function

```java
public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {}
```

## Input Format

- An array `nums` of integers representing elements.

## Output Format

- An integer, the majority element.

## Constraints

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## Follow-up

- Could you solve the problem in linear time and in `O(1)` space?

## Example

```bash
# Sample Input
nums = [3,2,3]

# Sample Output
3
```
