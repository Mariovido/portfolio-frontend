# 1639. Number of Ways to Form a Target String Given a Dictionary

## Description

Given a list of strings of the same length and a target string, the task is to form the target string using the given words under certain rules. The target should be formed from left to right, and to form each character of the target, you can choose characters from the strings in the list according to specific conditions. The goal is to determine the number of ways to form the target string.

## Function

```java
public int numWays(String[] words, String target) {}
```

## Input Format

- An array of strings `words` where each string has the same length.
- A string `target` representing the target string.

## Output Format

- An integer representing the number of ways to form the target string.

## Constraints

- `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 1000`
- All strings in `words` have the same length.
- `1 <= target.length <= 1000`
- `words[i]` and `target` contain only lowercase English letters.

## Example

```bash
# Sample Input
words = ["acca","bbbb","caca"], target = "aba"

# Sample Output
6
```
