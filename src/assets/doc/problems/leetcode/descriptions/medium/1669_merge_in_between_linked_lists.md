# 1669. Merge In Between Linked Lists

## Description

This problem involves modifying a linked list, `list1`, by removing a specified range of nodes and inserting another linked list, `list2`, in their place. The goal is to build and return the head of the resulting linked list after the modification.

## Function

```java
public ListNode mergeInBetween(ListNode list1, int a, int b, ListNode list2) {}
```

## Input Format

- `list1`: The first linked list of size `n`.
- `a`: The start position for removal in `list1`.
- `b`: The end position for removal in `list1`.
- `list2`: The second linked list of size `m` to be inserted into `list1`.

## Output Format

- Returns the head of the modified linked list after inserting `list2` into `list1` from position `a` to `b`.

## Constraints

- `3 <= list1.length <= 10^4`
- `1 <= a <= b < list1.length âˆ’ 1`
- `1 <= list2.length <= 10^4`

## Example

```bash
# Sample Input
list1 = [10,1,13,6,9,5], a = 3, b = 4, list2 = [1000000,1000001,1000002]

# Sample Output
[10,1,13,1000000,1000001,1000002,5]
```
