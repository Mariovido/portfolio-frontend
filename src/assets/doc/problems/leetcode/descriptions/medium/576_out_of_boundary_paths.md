# 576. Out of Boundary Paths

## Description

Given an `m * n` grid with a ball starting at a specified position, this problem involves counting the number of paths to move the ball out of the grid boundary. The ball is allowed to move to one of the four adjacent cells in the grid, and a maximum number of moves (`maxMove`) is provided.

## Function

```java
public int findPaths(int m, int n, int maxMove, int startRow, int startColumn) {}
```

## Input Format

- Five integers: `m`, `n`, `maxMove`, `startRow`, `startColumn`.

## Output Format

- An integer representing the number of paths to move the ball out of the grid boundary.
- Since the answer can be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Constraints

- `1 <= m, n <= 50`
- `0 <= maxMove <= 50`
- `0 <= startRow < m`
- `0 <= startColumn < n`

## Example

```bash
# Sample Input
m = 2, n = 2, maxMove = 2, startRow = 0, startColumn = 0

# Sample Output
6
```
