# 647. Palindromic Substrings

## Description

Given a string `s`, this problem involves counting the number of palindromic substrings in it. A string is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward, and a substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

## Function

```java
public int countSubstrings(String s) {}
```

## Input Format

- A string `s` of length `n` representing the input string &rarr; `1 <= n <= 1000`.
- The string consists of lowercase English letters.

## Output Format

- An integer representing the number of palindromic substrings in the input string.

## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- The string `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Example

```bash
# Sample Input
"abc"

# Sample Output
3
```
