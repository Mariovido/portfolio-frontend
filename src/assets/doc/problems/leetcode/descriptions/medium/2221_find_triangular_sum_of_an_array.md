# 2221. Find Triangular Sum of an Array

## Description

Given a `0`-indexed integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` is a digit between `0` and `9` (inclusive), this problem involves finding the triangular sum of the array. The triangular sum is the value of the only element present in `nums` after performing a specific process.

## Function

```java
public int triangularSum(int[] nums) {}
```

## Input Format

- The input array `nums` consists of integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive).

## Output Format

- An integer representing the triangular sum of the array.

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 9`

## Example

```bash
# Sample Input
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Sample Output
8
```
