# Connected Cells in a Grid

## Intuition

The problem appears to involve finding the largest connected region of `1`s in a matrix. One possible approach could be to use depth-first search (DFS) to explore all adjacent cells in the matrix starting from each cell containing a `1`.

## Approach

1. Initialize a variable `result` to store the maximum size of the connected region found.
2. Iterate over each cell in the matrix.
3. If the current cell contains a `1`, perform a depth-first search (DFS) to explore all adjacent cells connected to it.
4. During DFS, mark visited cells as `0` to avoid revisiting them.
5. Count the number of cells visited during DFS and update the `result` with the maximum count found.
6. Return the `result` as the size of the largest connected region.

## Complexity

- Time complexity: `O(n * m)` where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns in the matrix. This is because in the worst case, we may need to visit each cell once to perform DFS.

- Space complexity: `O(n * m)` for the recursive stack space used during DFS, where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns in the matrix.

## Code

```java
class Result {
    private static int[] offsets = {-1, 0, 1};

    public static int connectedCell(List<List<Integer>> matrix) {
        int result = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < matrix.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < matrix.get(i).size(); j++) {
                if (matrix.get(i).get(j) == 1) result = Math.max(result, dfs(i, j, matrix));
            }
        }

        return result;
    }

    private static int dfs(int i, int j, List<List<Integer>> matrix) {
        if (i < 0 || i >= matrix.size() || j < 0 || j >= matrix.get(i).size() || matrix.get(i).get(j) == 0) return 0;

        matrix.get(i).set(j, 0);
        int cells = 1;

        for (int rowOffset : offsets) {
            for (int columnOffset : offsets) {
                cells += dfs(i + rowOffset, j + columnOffset, matrix);
            }
        }

        return cells;
    }
}
```
