# Lonely Integer

## Description

Given an array of integers where all elements but one occur twice, this problem involves finding the unique element.

## Function

```java
public static int lonelyinteger(List<Integer> a) {}
```

## Input Format

- The first line: a single integer, `n`, the number of integers in the array.
- The second line: `n` space-separated integers that describe the values in the array.

## Output Format

- An integer, the element that occurs only once.

## Constraints

- `1 <= n < 100`
- It is guaranteed that `n` is an odd number and that there is one unique element.
- `0 <= a[i] <= 100`, where `0 <= i < n`.

## Example

```bash
# Sample Input
7
1 2 3 4 3 2 1

# Sample Output
4
```
