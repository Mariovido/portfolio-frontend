# Mini-Max Sum

## Description

Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. The program prints the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

## Function

```java
public static void miniMaxSum(List<Integer> arr) {}
```

## Input Format

- A single line of five space-separated integers &rarr; `1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9`.

## Output Format

- Two space-separated long integers, denoting the respective minimum and maximum values obtained by summing exactly four of the five integers.

## Constraints

- `1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9`

## Example

```bash
# Sample Input
1 2 3 4 5

# Sample Output
10 14
```
