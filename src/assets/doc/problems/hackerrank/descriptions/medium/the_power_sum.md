# The Power Sum

## Description

Given an integer `X` and an integer `N`, this problem involves finding the number of ways `X` can be expressed as the sum of the `N^{th}` powers of unique, natural numbers.

## Function

```java
public static int powerSum(int X, int N) {}
```

## Input Format

- The first line: an integer `X` representing the number to sum to.
- The second line: an integer `N` representing the power to raise numbers to.

## Output Format

- A single integer, the number of possible combinations calculated.

## Constraints

- `1 <= X <= 1000`
- `2 <= N <= 10`

## Example

```bash
# Sample Input
10
2

# Sample Output
1
```
